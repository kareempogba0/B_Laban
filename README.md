## üöÄ Getting Started

### Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kareempogba0/B_Laban.git
   cd B_Laban
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Firebase Configuration:**
   - Add your Firebase project configuration in `firebase.js`.
   - Set up Firestore Database and Authentication in [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
   - Update Firestore security rules accordingly.

5. **Email Configuration with Resend:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the example below.
   - Sign up at [Resend](https://resend.com) to get your API key.
   - Verify your domain in Resend dashboard for better deliverability.
   - Email functionality is enabled by default unless specifically disabled.
   - Add your Resend API key to the Cloudflare Pages environment variables as `RESEND_API_KEY`.
   - Customize your email addresses as needed.

   ```
   # Email Configuration
   # Email is enabled by default unless set to 'false'
   # REACT_APP_EMAIL_ENABLED=false
   
   REACT_APP_EMAIL_FROM=orders@yourdomain.com
   REACT_APP_SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@yourdomain.com
   ```

   The application uses Cloudflare Functions to handle email sending server-side, avoiding CORS issues. When deployed to Cloudflare Pages:
   
   1. Add the `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard.
   2. The Functions directory contains the server-side code that handles secure API calls to Resend.
   3. Emails are sent through a secure server-side function rather than directly from the browser.

   The application will automatically send order confirmation emails when orders are placed, and shipping notification emails when orders are shipped.
